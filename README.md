# xsv

XSV is an intermediary text format for interchange between relation databases and spreadsheets. It is based on the [TSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) (tab-separated values) format, with extra features like subsectioning (derived from [MIME multipart messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Multipart_messages)) and filesystem modeling, and supports [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)-compatible cell values.
